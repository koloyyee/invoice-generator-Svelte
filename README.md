# Invoice Creator with Svelte

This is a project for learning Svelte which is based on the project by Sank Thomas's invoicer project [https://github.com/SankThomas/invoicer_v2].

Coming from a ReactJS background I am learning Svelte especially state management, and how to apply the grid system with Tailwind CSS.

## moving forward

I have only discovered the tip of Svelte, moving forward I would like to learn how to apply setContext, also including a login system and a backend and MongoDB as a database of choice.
